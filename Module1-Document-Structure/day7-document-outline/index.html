                <h2>The Web Site Footer</h2>
                <p>One of the most important locations on your website is the footer. Yes, seriously. It may not be the area of the greatest design or most impressive content but it is a place where users frequently look for information. So it is vitally important that you don’t neglect this area when planning a web design project.</p>
        

                <p>But what elements should you include? How can you keep the footer organized and in line with your overall aesthetic without being obtrusive? You’ve come to the right place. Here we’ll look at tips for creating a great footer with examples of some websites that are doing it well.</p>

                <h2>Keep The Design Simple</h2>
                <p>Yes, this is one of the keys to most design projects, but it is worth stating right off the bat. Simple design is important when working with a lot of information, which will likely be the case for a footer. Stick to clean elements, plenty of space and organize with purpose. Try to avoid clutter and think about what elements will live in your footer and why they should be there. Footer size is often related to the amount of information and number of pages on your website.</p>
                <p>Many web sites use color, icons and text in the footer but it is simple and has great flow. Every link is easy to click and the subtle detail with the farm image in the green box is a nice touch.

                <h2>Link To Your Information</h2>
                <p>Two of the most important links in any website footer go to the “About Us” and “Contact Us” pages. Users will want to know who you are and what your company or brand is about. Make it easy to find that information. Many will also want to know about your team members and how to reach them. (This is a vital tool. Many people lose business cards and will return to your website to retrieve that contact information.) Heckford includes plenty of links to the company, social media and information about their work.</p>

                <h2>Include Basic Contact Information</h2>
                <p>While you should link to a full “Contact Us” page, including relevant contact information in the footer is nice as well. Include a main phone number, email address and physical address. (Bonus points for setting each element up so that it auto dials, emails or maps when clicked.)</p>
                <p>The Root Studio created a footer that almost goes against everything you imagine when you think “footer,” but it works. The text is large (as well as the box that contains it) and it is boiled down to a super simple list of contact information. (This is a n impactful design concept for a website that wants users to contact them for projects and work.)</p>

                <h2> Organize Footer Links</h2>
                <p>Grouping like footer items can create a nice sense of organization for links and information. Consider several columns (or rows) of relevant information such as contact, links, services, social media and sections from your most popular pages. Place each section under and header so that every element is easy to see and find.
                <p>Sugar Sync includes multiple columns of information for easy access to footer information. With “Product,” “Company,” Learn More” and “Connect with Us” headers, it is easy to find the part of the site you want to use next.</p>

                <h2>Include A Copyright Notice</h2>
                <p>This tiny line of text can be a lifesaver. Don’t forget it. While most sites include it as a single line across the bottom of the screen, you can design it to be more integrated into the rest of the footer. A copyright notice can be written or include the small, circular “c” symbol. The text often includes the year of publication and name of the copyright owner. Multiple copyright notices can account for content and design (for sites that are partially created by a third party.)</p>
                <p>Adventure.com keeps it simple with a copyright notice at the bottom right of the screen. The information features low-contrast type so that it does not get in the way of more important footer navigation elements.</p>
