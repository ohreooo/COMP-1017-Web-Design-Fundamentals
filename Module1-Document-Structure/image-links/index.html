        <h1>Top Ten Social Media Sites</h1>
          <p>The world's most popular social networking sites certainly have changed over the years, and they'll undoubtedly continue to change as time moves forward. Old social networks will die, popular ones will stick around as they're forced to evolve, and brand new ones will appear.</p>


        <h2>Facebook</h2>

        <p>Most of us already know that Facebook is the top social network on the web. It's a thriving beast of a social networking site on the web with over 1.59 billions monthly active users as of December 2015 and over one billion that log on daily (according to Facebook itself). Statistashows that Facebook Messenger is also the second most popular messaging app behind WhatsApp. After failing to acquire Snapchat in 2013, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 so that it could be the one that was one top of instant messaging.</p>

        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <a href="https://www.twitter.com/" target="blank"><img src="img/twitter.jpg"
            alt="twitter logo" /></a>
        <p>Twitter is known as the real-time, publicmicroblogging network where news breaks first. Most users loved it for its iconic 140-character limit and unfiltered feed that showed them absolutely everything. Twitter has changed dramatically over the years, and today it's criticized a lot for going the way of looking and functioning almost exactly like Facebook. Besides Twitter Card integration, which now makes it easy to share all sorts of multimedia content in tweets, you can expect to see algorithmic timelines coming to Twitter soon as well.  </p>

        <h2>Linkedin</h2>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="blank"><img src="img/linkedin.jpg"
            alt="linkedin logo" /></a>
        <p>LinkedIn is a social network for professionals. Anyone who needs to make connections to advance their careers should be on LinkedIn. Profiles are designed to look sort of like extremely detailed resumes, with sections for work experience, education, volunteer work, certifications, awards and all sorts of other relevant work-related information. Users can promote themselves and their businesses by making connections with other professionals, interacting in group discussions, posting job ads, applying to jobs, publishing articles to LinkedIn pulse and so much more. </p> 


        <h2>Google +</h2>
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/profile" target="blank"><img src="img/google-plus.jpg"
            alt="google plus logo" /></a>
        <p>Making its debut in the early summer of 2011, Google+ became the fastest growing social network the web has ever seen. After failing a couple times already with Google Buzz and Google Wave, the search giant finally succeeded at creating something that stuck... kind of. Nobody really needed another Facebook clone, so Google+ had always been widely criticized for being a social network that nobody really used. In late 2015, a brand new Google+ was rolled out to put more emphasis on its Communities and Collections features to help differentiate the platform a bit more and give existing users more of what they wanted.   </p>

        <h2>YouTube</h2>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="blank"><img src="img/youtube.jpg"
            alt="YouTube logo" /></a>
        <p> Where does everyone go to watch or share video content online? It's obviously YouTube. After Google, YouTube is the second largest search engine. Despite being owned by Google, YouTube can still be recognized as a separate social network all on its own as the premiere place online to go to watch videos on every topic under the sun and upload your own as well. From music videos and movies, to personal vlogs and independent films, YouTube has it all. YouTube recently launched a premium subscription option, called YouTube Red, which removes all advertisements from videos.  </p>


        <h2>Pinterest</h2>
        <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="blank"><img src="img/pinterest.jpg"
            alt="pinterest logo" /></a>
        <p>Pinterest has become a major player both in social networking and in the search world, proving just how important visual content has become on the web. As the fastest standalone site ever to reach 10 million monthly unique visits, Pinterest'sbeautiful and intuitive pinboard-style platform is one of the most enticing and useful resource for collecting the best images that can be categorized into separate boards. Pinterest is also growing to become a huge influencer in social shopping, now featuring "Buy" buttons right on pins of products sold by some retailers. </p>

        <h2>Vine</h2>
        <a href="https://vine.co/" target="blank"><img src="img/vine.jpg"
            alt="vine logo" /></a>
        <p> Vine is a mobile video sharing app owned by Twitter, and boy is it ever entertaining! If you don't have the attention span to watch a full YouTube video, then you'll love Vine. One of the most convenient things about Vine is that its videos can be directly embedded inline on Twitter when shared through a tweet. They can also be embedded on a website. Videos play on autoloop and are limited to a maximum of six seconds, but that doesn't stop it from being such a powerful social network. Several Vine stars have mastered the art of creating entertaining Vine videos, and many prefer it over Instagram video.  </p>

        <h2>Flickr</h2>
        <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="blank"><img src="img/logo-unknown.jpg"
            alt="flickr logo" /></a>
        <p>Flickr is Yahoo's popular photo-sharing network, which existed long before other popular competing networks likePinterest and Instagram entered the social photo sharing game. It's still one of the best places to upload photos, create albums and show off your photography skills to your friends. Yahoo has also worked hard at regularly updating its mobile apps with lots of great features and functions so that it's easy and enjoyable to use from a mobile device. Users can upload 1,000 GB worth of photos for free to Flickr and use the powerful app to organize and edit them however they like. </p>
